[[Here is an idea of the intro text we can display on the initial splash screen
and possibly upon pressing a help button as well.]]

Welcome to Hivemind!

Hivemind is a simple app that will help you take, share, and organize your
notes!

With Hivemind, all notes belong to a "hive". Hives are used to categorize your
notes, say, for different classes you're taking or different projects you're
working on.

To get started, simply choose a hive and add some notes! If you're joining a
hive which already has notes, you'll be able to see them right after joining.
If you're in a hive, you have access to all of the notes in that hive!

[[Any other features that we add or anything else we should say can go here.
Please feel free to change/reword anything you'd like.]]
