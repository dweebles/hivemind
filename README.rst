Contributions will be rejected until the completion of the course.
This must be our own work for now.

Marc, Duy, and I (oddshocks) all have commit access to the
oddshocks/hivemind repo on GitHub.

Operation
---------

This section will be used to contain ideas related to the design of the
actual notetaking/sharing functionality of the application.
